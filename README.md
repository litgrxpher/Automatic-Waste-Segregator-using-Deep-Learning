# Automatic-Waste-Segregator-using-Deep-Learning
"Automatic Waste Segregator: This project revolutionizes waste management through advanced technology integration. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and Arduino microcontrollers, it achieves precise waste sorting into categories like metal, paper, plastic, and organic. The system incorporates cameras, IR sensors, and Python scripts for seamless operation. Inspired by the structure and 3D models found in a Hackaday.io project (link: https://hackaday.io/project/191802-ai-audio-classifier-recycle-bin), it optimizes waste segregation processes and promotes sustainability."
